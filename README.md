# 🤖 Robotic Food Warehouse System

## 📌 Project Description

This project is about designing and building a robotic system that automates the handling of food materials inside a warehouse **without any human intervention**. The robot is responsible for picking, sorting, and placing food items efficiently between storage shelves and an output box.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop an autonomous robotic arm that:
- Scans and identifies food items in shelves.
- Picks up items and places them on a central table.
- Moves the items to a designated output container.
- Operates within a fixed working environment.

---

## 🧠 Execution Algorithm

1. Start in the initial (home) position.
2. Scan the shelves for items.
3. Move to the item location.
4. Grab the item using the gripper.
5. Place the item on the working table for sorting/processing.
6. Transfer the item to the output box.
7. Repeat until all items are processed.
